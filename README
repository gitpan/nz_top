README for nz_top version 0.01
==============================

ABOUT

  nz_top is a 'top' clone for Netezza. The idea came from mytop and pgtop.

  nz_top is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the performance
  of Netezza. It runs on most Unix systems which have Perl and Term::ReadKey
  installed. 

  Netezza provides a Windows admin tool that monitors the performance of the database.
  But it means that you have to use Windows to run the tool. This is meant to 
  help the user to quickly see what is happening on the database.

  The advantage of using this tool is that it can show you the plan files that
  the Netezza optimizer will attempt to execute on the query. 

REQUIREMENTS

  TermReadKey from CPAN.
  
  If you will be using this outside of your Netezza box, then the Netezza client
  needs to be installed since it will use the following files. Also, make sure that
  these files are in your working path.

  nzsession, nzstats, nzsql

  Note that the tests will fail if the Netezza client is not installed or it cannot
  find in your working path.

  Tested on Netezza version 4.6.2 .
